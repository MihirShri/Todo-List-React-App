# Todo-List-React-App
This is a web application created using the ReactJS library. It displays a todo-list and crosses the items out as you mark them as done.

# Getting-Started
Inside the todo-list folder open Command Prompt (on windows) and type - **npm start** <br/>
The app will automatically open in the web browser.<br/>
If it does not, then open <a>http://localhost:3000</a> to view it in the browser.

# Note
Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine.
To add your own data, go to **todo-list -> src -> todosData.js** In the **todosData.js** file, change the data to whatever you want to be displayed.
